## Media / Creation
- [**MPV**](http://mpv.io) - Media/video player, extremely customizable. Integrated with YoutubeDL for streaming content.
- [**XMPlay**](http://support.xmplay.com/) - Tiny audio player. Grab [this skin](http://support.xmplay.com/files_view.php?file_id=557) as the default design is ugly. It also plays [old school tracker music](https://modarchive.org) and has plugins for game console sound files!
- [**Adobe Fireworks**](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/fireworks.html) - Discontinued bitmap/vector editing tool. The ultimate compromise between Photoshop and Illustrator. RIP Macromedia :(

## Retired
- [**AquaSnap Pro**](https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) - (Windows 10) Tiling window manager. Snap, dock & tile windows. Windows 11 built-in management is sufficient.
- [**Cmder**](http://cmder.net) - replaced by Windows Terminal. Command prompt manager. Setup in quasi-Quake console mode.
- [**Sandboxie**](https://www.sandboxie.com) - Isolate potentially pesky/untrusted applications, to be retired once Windows 10 built-in sandboxing UX has improved.
- [**sWeather**](http://www.dcmembers.com/skwire/download/sweather/) - replaced by TrayWeather. Data source no longer exists. Weather reporting, no fuss with plenty of customization options. Pre-dates Win 10's broken mess by at least 8 years :P
- [**Audio Switcher**](Change%20Audio.ahk) - replaced by SoundSwitch. File available for reference.
- [**KatMouse**](http://ehiti.de/katmouse/) - 
- **SpeedFan** - Monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures and check drive SMART status. Not updated actively so it has been mostly replaced by HWInfo
- **ScreenToGif** - replaced by LiceCAP. Editor UI is nice but the exported gifs are large.
- [**DisplayFusion**](https://www.displayfusion.com/) - Advanced wallpaper manager and misc. tweaks. No longer change my wallpaper frequently enough to care, although I do rarely use it to generate multi-monitor wallpaper.
- [**iRotate**](https://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm) - Screen rotation hotkeys. I now have two monitors in both portrait & landscape, so I have no need for it anymore.
